make tui/gui
make all function smaller functions with designated tasks

make one main python file that asks if you want to create a new validsongs list or use the current one
make a textfile that shows the stats of all songs in the playlist, you could link to it in the playlist descriptiom by having it be stored on the website
finally ask the user for input to connect to spotify

instead of a one dimension array use a 2d array for storing the song and the treshold value and the date, maybe a jsonfile would be better
the ui should also ask for the amount of songs and then it will add songs high to low until the treshold is met
it then sorts the array again based on the date
implement this in a website where you can request your data and stuff, you could make it available for 2 euro or something, dependent on the amount of data there is

in the end more functionality could be added to the website
for example add a discover playlist maker where you say what kindof of genre you want, this could be done with a few sample songs, and maybe you could say i want to discover this language in that genre
